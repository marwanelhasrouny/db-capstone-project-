Due to bad connection and having and old system, I couldn't work with both Tableau cloud and Tableau desktop, but i know the steps to do it.

Here are the steps to connect to the MySQL database in Tableau:

1-Open Tableau Desktop and click on the "Connect to Data" button on the start page.

2-In the "To a Server" section, select "MySQL" from the list of data sources.

3-Enter the server name, port number, database name, username, and password in the fields provided.

4-Click on the "Sign In" button to connect to the database.

5-If the connection is successful, you should see a list of tables in the database.

6-Select the table or tables you want to work with and drag them onto the canvas.

7-Once you have the data on the canvas, you can create a visualization by dragging fields onto the rows and columns shelves, and adding filters, marks, and other elements as needed.


Here are the steps to generate data reports using Tableau:

1. Connect to the data source by following the steps in my previous response.

2. Drag the desired fields to the Rows and Columns shelves to build a chart or graph.

3. Customize the chart or graph by adding or removing fields, changing the chart type, adjusting the axis, and adding filters or groups as needed.

4. To create a report, drag the chart or graph to the "New Worksheet" button at the bottom of the screen.

5. On the new worksheet, you can add additional charts or graphs, tables, text boxes, and other elements to create a complete report.

6. Customize the layout by resizing and moving elements, and adjusting the colors and fonts to match your branding.

7. Add filters to the report to allow users to interact with the data and explore it in more detail.

8. Once the report is complete, you can share it with others by publishing it to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, or by exporting it as a PDF, image, or other file format.

Some tips for creating effective data reports in Tableau:

- Keep the report simple and easy to read. Avoid cluttering the report with too many charts, tables, or text boxes.

- Use colors and fonts consistently to maintain a professional appearance.

- Provide context for the data by adding labels, legends, and other descriptive elements.

- Use filters and groups to allow users to explore the data in more detail.

- Use tooltips to provide additional information when users hover over a data point.

- Test the report thoroughly to ensure that the data is accurate and the report is easy to use.
